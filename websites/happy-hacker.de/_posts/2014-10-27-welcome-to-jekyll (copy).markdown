Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Ensign Babyface! I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. 

Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. This should be interesting. Your shields were failing, sir. I am your worst nightmare! And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Travel time to the nearest starbase? The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. You enjoyed that. The unexpected is our normal routine. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Not if I weaken first.

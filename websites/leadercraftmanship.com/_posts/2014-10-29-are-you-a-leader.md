Perhaps you say "yes" because you are in a management position. Perhaps you say "no" because you don't have an official management title on your business card. Perhaps you say "no" even when you are in a management position but you say "I've never learnt to lead people".

I think today everybody can be a leader, everybody should be a leader and probably everybody already is a leader. Leadership isn't just a thing that happens on the job. Leadership takes place in all parts of our everyday life. 

If you have children, you already (hopefully) lead them towards living a responsibe life. If you ever organized an event or a vacation with your friends, you've been a leader there. If something needs to be done and you stand up for it, you are a leader.

Leadership is all about getting you and the people around you motivated to get things done. It's not about titles, dresscodes or budgets - it's just about standing up, getting stuff done and saying "I will go this way, who want's to follow?".

Whether you are a leader or not is your decision. Will it be the blue pill or the red pill for you?

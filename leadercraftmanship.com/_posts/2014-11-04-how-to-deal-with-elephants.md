How do you get an elephant into an refrigerator? You open the door, push the elephant inside and close the door. That's simple.

And how do you eat an elephant? Bit by bit. (BTW, you shouldn't eat elephants)

How do you deal with the elephant in the room when you are the leader of a group? Or at least if the people around you expect you to take the initiative? *You address the elephant!* When there are unsolved problems or situations in a group, it is the job of you as a leader to address them and start the solution process. 

Nothing is more frustrating than latent conflicts in a group that don't get solved. Usually all people recognize that there is a conflict but they expect the leader to take the initiative and start solving the problem. Perhaps the leader should take the persons involved and show them a way to overcome their troubles. Perhaps there are problems with people outside your group and you as a leader should “protect” your tribe. And perhaps your people can't come to an agreement about a technical problem and it's your job to guide them to a conclusion.

Are you a member of a (true) agile team? In those environments everybody is expected to act as a leader. When you work in an agile team and there are elephants in your office, it is your job as well as everybody else's job to address the problems and work towards a solution.

Do you address the elephant in the room in your tribes?

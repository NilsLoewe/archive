When you are in a leadership position you need to focus your people on a common target. Everybody who is involved should work towards the same goal. But how do you motivate your team to reach that goal?

Perhaps you think about these manipulation techniques you've heard about or you think about setting objectives. I don't think that these strategies really work. Management is about manipulating resources to get a known job done. But we don't simply want to get a job done, we want to lead our people towards our common goal.

The first step to achieve this is to make the target really the target of your group. Don't simply say “This is the target, now let's get the job done”. If you define the target yourself or you have the permission to adjust a given target, you should work together with your team on the definition of your shared goal. Everybody should contribute because everybody has to commit to the target. If you can't change a given target, you should have the discussion anyway – just to get everybody on-board.

When the target is defined, start creating a strong vision of your shared destination. Describe how it will be when you succeed with your project. How much value will be created for your customers? How good will it feel to build a great product? Visualize the moment when you all succeed together as a team.

To manifest this vision in your team you need the burning desire to reach that goal yourself. If you tell your team where to go and don't believe in the way or you don't really care, you can't possibly create a strong vision.

So in your current project, do you all share a vision of your project goals?

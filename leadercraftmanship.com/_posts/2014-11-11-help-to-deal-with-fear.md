We all fear something from time to time. Sometimes we face these fears and sometimes we don't. But if you are leading a group of people, you can't hide from your fears – you have to face them. But you don't only have to handle your own fears, you have to help your followers to handle their own fears as well.

Why can't you hide yourself? That is almost obvious – you are the leader and you should be the role model for your tribe. If you don't handle your own problems or fears yourself, why should you expect that from your tribe? If you don't provide a good example for the people who want or should follow you, you can't expect courageous behavior from them.

Why meet fears anyway? There are several reasons why you shouldn't hide from fears, independent of being a leader or not.

**You always fear what you don't understand**

When you encounter a fear, perhaps you've come across something you did not understand yet. Perhaps you weren't aware of that and perhaps you should have understood it. Whatever, you can use fearful feelings as a trigger for something your unconscious mind wants to tell you.

**Fear as a result of lack of self-confidence**

Perhaps you are not so sure about something as you should be. As a leader you're expected to make decisions. When you fear a decision, perhaps you don't know enough to make this decision? Use your fears as a trigger to dig deeper into the details of something you have to decide about.

Another part of your job as a leader is to encourage your people. If one of your followers fears some task, perhaps you need to give him or her more guidance? Did you pass all information that is necessary to fulfill the task? Did you make your expectations clear?

**Fear of conflicts**

Many people fear conflicts. Many people or organizations try to avoid conflicts because they fear them or there is no working culture of conflicts. But conflicts can be used to become very strong and productive as a team or a group. You just have to use them right! Don't accept people attacking each other on a personal level – always moderate conflicts to a professional level about content. If you encourage conflict on a professional level and you build the trust between your people, nobody has to fear conflicts.


_There are many more reasons for fears. As a leader you have to watch your fears and you also have to watch for the fears your tribe encounters. Do you help your tribe to encounter it's fears?_
